# Deploy Mini-App

```bash
# Deploy a mini-app
portex deploy <app-name> <build-path> [description]
```

## Description

The `portex deploy` command is used to upload an application package from the specified build path. This command allows users to deploy applications by providing the application name and build path. It compresses the application files into a zip format, calculates the MD5 checksum, retrieves a presigned URL for uploading, and finally uploads the compressed file.

After a successful upload, the command will display the applicationâ€™s last deployed version, and users can use the `portex publish` command to publish the new version.

| 2    | Calculate MD5 Checksum   | Calculates the MD5 checksum of the compressed zip file to ensure data integrity during upload.                                                  |
| 3    | Get Presigned URL        | Retrieves a presigned URL from the API to upload the file securely.                                                                             |

| 5    | Show Application Version | Displays the last deployed version of the application. Users can then use the `portex publish` command with the next version number to publish. |

## Success and Failure Messages
